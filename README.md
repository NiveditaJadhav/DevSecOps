🛡️ DevSecOps Pipeline Integration Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on integrating security into the DevOps pipeline by adopting DevSecOps practices. It ensures security is a continuous and automated part of development, testing, and deployment processes across multiple environments.

The pipeline incorporates automated security scans, vulnerability assessments, and compliance checks within the CI/CD workflow, enabling proactive identification and resolution of security risks.

The project emphasizes secure coding practices, container security, and infrastructure security from development to production, reducing breach risks and enhancing compliance posture.

🚀 Pipeline Workflow

Code Commit & Build: Developers push code to GitLab/Jenkins, triggering the CI/CD pipeline.

Static Code Analysis: SonarQube scans for code quality and vulnerabilities.

Containerization: Build Docker images for the application.

Container Security: Scan images using Aqua Security or Sysdig.

Vulnerability Scanning: Run security scans using Snyk or Trivy.

Secrets Management: Manage sensitive credentials with HashiCorp Vault.

Security Testing: Conduct dynamic security testing using OWASP ZAP.

Infrastructure Deployment: Provision secure cloud infrastructure via Terraform/CloudFormation.

Continuous Monitoring: Monitor security issues and compliance post-deployment.

🎯 Project Goals:

✅ Automate security within the CI/CD pipeline.
✅ Proactively identify and resolve security vulnerabilities.
✅ Ensure secure coding, container security, and infrastructure security.
✅ Improve compliance posture and reduce security risks.

📂 How to Run

1.Clone the Repository:  
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/devsecops-pipeline.git
  cd devsecops-pipeline

2. Configure CI/CD Pipelines: 
   - Add `.gitlab-ci.yml` for **GitLab CI** or `Jenkinsfile` for **Jenkins**.  
3. Set Up Tools:
   - Install **Docker, SonarQube, HashiCorp Vault**, and other tools.  
4. Deploy Infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
5.Run Security Scans:
   ```bash
   snyk test  
   trivy image your-app-image  
   zap-baseline.py -t http://your-app-url  
   ```  

💡 Future Enhancements:

📊 Integrate centralized security dashboards (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus).

🚀 Implement auto-remediation for detected vulnerabilities.

🔒 Enhance IAM and Role-based Access Controls (RBAC).
